# Best Practices for Repository Organization and Deployment

When structuring your infrastructure and application projects, it's a recommended practice to separate different parts into dedicated repositories. This facilitates code management, collaboration, and maintenance. Here are some guidelines on how to organize your repositories:

## Repository Organization

### 1. Backend
- **Purpose:** Store the source code related to the backend of your application, such as servers, APIs, business logic, etc.
- **Example Directory Structure:**
    ```plaintext
    /backend
        /src
        /config
        Dockerfile
## 2. Frontend

- **Purpose:** Contains the source code for the frontend of your application, such as user interfaces, styles, scripts, etc.

- **Example Directory Structure:**
    ```plaintext
    /frontend
        /src
        /public
        Dockerfile
## 3. Helm

- **Purpose:** Store Helm charts that describe the Kubernetes infrastructure of your application.

- **Example Directory Structure:**
    ```plaintext
    /helm
        /charts
        Chart.yaml
        values.yaml
## 4. Terraform

- **Purpose:** Contains Terraform code to provision and manage the infrastructure needed for your application.

- **Example Directory Structure:**
    ```plaintext
    /terraform
        /modules
        /environments
        main.tf
        variables.tf
        outputs.tf
# Advantages

- **Focused Management:** Each repository deals with a specific concern, making it easier to understand, update, and maintain the code.

- **Reuse:** Repositories can be reused in other projects, promoting modularity and consistency.

- **Efficient Collaboration:** Teams can work in parallel on different parts of the application without interference.

- **Specific CI/CD:** Specific CI/CD pipelines can be implemented for each part of the application, providing greater flexibility.

# Suggested Deployment Flow

1. **Updates to Backend or Frontend:** Developments and specific changes are made in the backend and frontend repositories.

2. **Updates to Helm Chart:** Changes to Kubernetes infrastructure are reflected in the Helm charts of the helm repository.

3. **Updates to Terraform:** Modifications to cloud infrastructure are managed in the terraform repository.

4. **Continuous Integration:** Implement specific CI/CD pipelines for each repository to ensure automated testing, builds, and deployments.

5. **Orchestrated Deployment:** Coordinate deployments in different parts of the application as needed.

By following these practices, you can create a more modular, easily manageable, and collaborative development environment. This will result in a more efficient and sustainable implementation of your application.
